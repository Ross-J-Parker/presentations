## Basic Syntax

### Variables and Data Types

*   Variables are dynamically typed (you don't need to declare their type).

    ```python
    name = "Alice"  # String
    age = 30        # Integer
    height = 5.8    # Float
    is_student = False  # Boolean
    ```

### Operators

*   Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (floor division), `%` (modulo), `**` (exponentiation).
*   Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
*   Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`.

### Control Flow

#### If statements

```python
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
